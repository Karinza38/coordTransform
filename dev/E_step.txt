	Field explanation:
	|*| WGS84: The input WGS84 value pair (N, E).
	|*| WGS84 (Back-Derived): Back derived (using "BD09 (Referential)") through "BD09toWGS84".
	|*| GCJ02 (Back-Derived): Back derived through "BD09toGCJ02".
	|*| GCJ02: Generated with "WGS84toGCJ02".
	|*| BD09: Generated with "WGS84toBD09".
	|*| BD09 (Referential): Referential returned by Baidu's API ([ https://api.map.baidu.com/marker?output=html&coord_type=wgs84&location=N,E ], replace the "location" parameter accordingly).
